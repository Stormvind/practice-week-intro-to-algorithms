# practice-week-intro-to-algorithms

This is some stuff I did this week during my practice. The theme of this week was an introduction to algorithms.
I have three things in this repository:

1. A function that takes a sorted array of numbers and a target number, and returns the index of the target number in the array. If the target number is not in the array, then false is returned.

2. My solution to the staircase problem. The staircase problem is the following:
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top? (1 step, 2 steps, 1 step is distinct from 1 step, 1 step, 2 steps)

3. A function that searches for a string in a pre existing collection and finds the most similar string, even if an exact match to what was searched for doesn't exist.
